# Docker Php OpenApi Client

The Docker Php OpenApi Client is autogenerated from the swagger / openapi specification provided by Docker.

## Versioning
Please be aware, that this package does not use semver. The version string is build from three parts:

```v{jane-php version}.{docker engine api major}.{docker engine api minor}.{library patch}```

The version ```v6.1.40.0``` would be a client for the *docker engine api* version **v1.40** build with *jane-php* **6.***.
This name scheme is mandatory, as the *jane-php* major version will most likely break compatibility.
